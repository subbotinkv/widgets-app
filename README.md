# Widget App

**Summary** : Widget management REST API

**Requirements**:

* Language - Java 11; Framework - Spring Boot; Build tool - Maven; 
* Do only the server-side, you donâ€™t need to do visualization;
* No need to do any authorization;
* No explicit limits on memory or runtime, but the more efficient the implementation, the better;
* You can assume that 90% of load distribution is read operations;
* The API should respect to REST architecture;
* Data should be stored in memory. You can use any classes of the standard library to organize storage. Using any external repositories and databases is forbidden.
* All changes to widgets must occur atomically. The Z-index must be unique.
* At least 30% of the code should be covered by unit and integration tests;
* Submit sources via a public git repository.

**Requirements (optional)**:

* Paging: implement a pagination mechanism for a list of widgets;
* SQL database: provide another storage implementation what works with SQL-database. The choice of storage implementation should be determined in the server configuration.

## Description

### TL;DR

Build:

    $mvn clean install
Run (in-memory):

    $mvn spring-boot:run -Drun.profiles=map
Run (h2):

    $mvn spring-boot:run -Drun.profiles=h2
API:

    http://localhost:8080/api/widgets
Swagger:

    http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/

### General

Tha app is a Spring Boot Application. It runs in an embedded webserver (tomcat).   

### REST API

The API in the app is designed according to REST-principles. [Zalando RESTful API Guidelines](https://opensource.zalando.com/restful-api-guidelines/#) were used during the design of API. The API also has Swagger-documentation - [http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/).
[Problem JSON](https://github.com/zalando/problem-spring-web/) is used to represent any problem occurred during processing of REST API calls in a unified way.

### Business logic

All the logic related to widget management (z-index changes) is located in service layer. ReadWriteLock is used to manage concurrent access to widgets data.

### Storage

#### In-Memory storage

HashMap collection class is used to organize the storage. Spring profile "map" should be used to activate this repository implementation.

#### SQL Database

H2 is used as an embedded SQL database. Spring profile "h2" should be used to activate this repository implementation.
Auto DDL generation provided by Spring boot is used to initialize the application database. 
There is no unique constraint on z_index column in the database, because H2 (and also Derby & HSQLDB) doesn't support deferred constraints.
Z-index uniqueness is controlled by application.
